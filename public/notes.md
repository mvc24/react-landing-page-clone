# repeated elements to style together (and other notes)

- link - button style
- cards
  - large "home card" has 4em padding
  - smaller ones have 2.5em
- p, h2, h3
- 'organic bullets' made with the svg in the background
- "eyebrow" div, uppercase
- Border radius issues:
  - "Join otter" button has a border radius of 999px (WTF?)
  - white repeated button link has a border radius of 99em
  - "now in beta" div (not a button) has a 20px border radius, but less padding
  - hero container: 4.5em border radius
- hero container:
  - make sure to be aware of z-index
  - background wrapper is absolute to container cc-hero
